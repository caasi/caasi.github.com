前幾天 [@lovecankill][lovecankill-twitter] 提到 [The Haskell School of Music: From Signals to Symphonies][school-of-music] 出版了。

查了下才知道在 Paul Hudak 過世後， Donya Quick 接手完成整本書。

Reddit 上的 lovaz 快三年前擔心沒人接手，[曾問][lovaz-3pt3dg]：

> But, as some of you know, Mr. Hudak passed away earlier this year and the book is now finished - chapters on frequency modulation are only half way done. Physical Modelling chapter has a lot of empty spaces. I can't understand ideas presented there if there is no explanation :(

hsyl20 回答道：

> You should ask Donya Quick: http://donyaquick.com/ I have been told she is to complete the book.
