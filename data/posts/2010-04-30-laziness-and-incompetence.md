> An anecdote I heard one time in regards to version control:
>
> A younger programmer asked an elder about his code and his coding style, and how the older programmer would do certain things. The older programmer said &#8216;Let&#8217;s take a look at your code&#8217;, so the younger took out his laptop, opened his editor, and showed him.
>
> The older programmer looked at the code, thought about it for a bit, and then started editing it. He deleted the class internals, leaving only the structure, and then rearranged the structure, saying &#8216;Here&#8217;s how I would do it to make it more efficient and readable&#8217;. After he was done, he saved the file and gave it back to the younger programmer, who was ashen-faced.
>
> 'That&#8230; My code is gone!' said the younger programmer. 'But you have it in version control somewhere, right?' asked the elder. 'N&#8230;. no.' was the reply. 'Well then,' said the older, 'now you've learned two lessons.'
